## Description
This is an employee or a user directory app, depending on what you use it for. Having a long list of your employees can be beneficial to employers, as you can very easily look up the employee you want to contact and get their email or their phone number. Sorting the employees by name alphabetically can make this process even easier!

I learned a lot about React, and how to sort a table alphabetically.
